# Helium Compiler

A compiler that compiles Helium, a Java-like programming language.

Helium has the extension `.he` (after Helium's symbol, He)

Heavily inspired by this YouTube series which compiles a programming language called Hydrogen: [Creating a Compiler](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUDlas_Zy_qC7c5tCgTMYq2idyyT241qs&feature=shared)

Currently, a work in progress.

## Helium Interpreter
Seen as though making a compiler is hard, that part is currently on hold, in favour of making an interpreter for the
language.

This will help flesh out what the language will look like, and allow it to develop a standard form, which should make
coding the compiler easier since the end goal will already be somewhat in sight.


### Helium Scripter
Seen as though the languages is being interpreted, one might as well have a scripter.

Currently, it does not exist, however when it does it will be a sort of line-by-line input, so Helium will be able to be
run like a scripting language. This will not be very fast, but will hopefully make up by being versatile. Hopefully.
