# Helium Compiler

A compiler that compiles Helium, a Java-like programming language.

Helium has the extension `.he` (after Helium's symbol, He)

Heavily inspired by this YouTube series which compiles a programming language called Hydrogen: [Creating a Compiler](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUDlas_Zy_qC7c5tCgTMYq2idyyT241qs&feature=shared)

Currently, a work in progress.
